This repository contains source code of Multimedia Web Databases Project Phase 1

The phase involves extraction of Color Histogram, SIFT Vectors and Motion Vectors of the various videos that are provided and write them as vector output for further manipulations.
The three tasks are:
1. Color Histogram Extraction - Matlab Feature
2. Sift Vector Extraction - Using SIFT Library
3. Motion Vector Extraction - Using FFMPEG Library

The output directory contains output files for the three tasks listed. 

The following code does the following functionalities:
\n 1. code/firstTask/colorHist.m - contains code for color histogram extraction from video files
\n 2. code/sift/siftVectEx.m - contains code to extract SIFT vector features from the video files
\n 3. code/myCode.m - contains code to extract motion vector from given video files

Note: Have removed the sift vector output from the output folder due to size constraints
